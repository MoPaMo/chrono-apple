# Chrono-Apple - Art Through the Ages: A Visual Journey

## Project Description
This project aims to visually represent the evolution of art styles throughout history using a single subject: an apple. By depicting the same object across different art movements, we create a unique and engaging way to explore the characteristics of each period.

## Features
- JSON dataset of major art movements, including dates, descriptions, and Wikipedia links

## Data Structure
The `art_movements.json` file contains an array of objects, each representing an art movement with the following properties:
- `name`: The name of the art movement
- `start_date`: The approximate start date of the movement (ISO 8601 format)
- `end_date`: The approximate end date of the movement (ISO 8601 format, or null if ongoing)
- `description`: A brief description of how an apple might be depicted in this style
- `period_description`: A short overview of the art movement
- `wikipedia_link`: A link to the Wikipedia page for more information
